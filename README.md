Our hackathon project centered around creating an innovative web user interface for a solar energy company, aiming to not only showcase their diverse range of products and services but also to educate the public on the benefits and workings of solar technology. The cornerstone of our design was the integration of a user-friendly solar panel configurator tool, allowing customers to tailor solar systems to their specific needs, enabling a hands-on, interactive experience. This tool demystifies the process of switching to solar energy, making it accessible and personalized. By blending information with interactivity, our project empowers users to make informed decisions about adopting sustainable energy solutions, reflecting our commitment to promoting renewable energy adoption through enhanced customer engagement and education.
